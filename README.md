As part of the NASA 2023 Space Apps Challenge, this repository aims to provide an accessible and extensive repository, 
combining inter-disciplinary databases to support research in methane emissions.

Methane, the second-highest contributor to climate change, is often overlooked despite its significant impact. Currently, data on methane is scattered. It is a challenge for researchers to track emissions, develop effective measures, and raise awareness about the issue.

The processing of data is initially organized in two steps:

## 1. Data filtering
`1_filtering.py`

Databases from diverse sources are gathered and are prepared to be plotted.

## 2. Data plotting
`2_plotting.py`

Filtered dataframes are ready to generate combined plots in order to cross information from different sources.
