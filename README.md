# CH4nge

At Rodriguez Aerospace, our goal is to use open science to combat climate change more effectively.

Methane, the second-highest contributor to climate change, is often overlooked despite its significant impact. Currently, data on methane is scattered. It is a challenge for researchers to track emissions, develop effective measures, and raise awareness about the issue.

Our new platform 'CH4nge' aims to become the world's largest repository of open methane data, accelerating research and facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration for effective climate change solutions.

'CH4nge' empowers scientists and policymakers with comprehensive data, interactive maps and other tools to understand and assess methane emissions, sources, and impacts.

Whether itâ€™s by learning, tracking your own emissions or supporting local sustainability initiatives, we also encourage individuals to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

Join 'CH4nge' to drive climate action, and combat climate change.

## Processing
The processing of data is initially organized in two steps:

#### 1. Data filtering
`1_filtering.py`

Databases from diverse sources are gathered and are prepared to be plotted.

#### 2. Data plotting
`2_plotting.py`

Filtered dataframes are ready to generate combined plots in order to cross information from different sources.
